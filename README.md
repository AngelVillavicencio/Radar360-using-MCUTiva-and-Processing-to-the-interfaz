# Radar_interfaz_360_grados

if you wanna see project and the interfaz, check that video. url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X25fVzXjXbg&t=12s 
  
The project is about a radar.
I used _:
 -Microcontroller(TM4C123GXL) 
 -Module bluetooth(HC05)
 -App created in App Invertor(it was easy form to do a app).
 -Processing3 to built the interfaz.
 
 
The second version maybe could be a version Interfaz in the Web and use a Module wifi to connect my the microcontroller to the internet (I dont sure...)
